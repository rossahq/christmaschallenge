For Adam

Above is a .jar file, "AdamsChristmasChallenge.jar". 

A jar file is way to package together a bunch of code & other files into a single file to make it easy to share, it's commonly used in the software industry because of this. 

IMPORTANT: To get your present you will need to download the .jar file and find a way to run it! (Google is every programmer's best friend)
